Some scholars believe that due to a scarcity of magnesium and iron in the primordial nebula of the stellar system where these planets were formed, the crust of Prairiea planets once had a high quartz content,therefore creating a slow soil formation process due to its tough exterior.

Human beings have used virtual reality to iterate through space and time, created a virtual universe much larger than the real world, and uploaded all human consciousness into it.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the virtual universe requires immense computing capabilities. To achieve this, humans have invented a supercomputer that surrounds the sun and name it \"CentreBrain\", hoping to use its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the virtual Homeland. As the number of consciousnesses continues to grow, CentreBrain's computing power will soon reach its limit. After all, more consciousnesses means more energy supply. For this reason, the COSMO launched a project with the code name \"Dyson Sphere Program\", assigning engineers to the real world to build Dyson Spheres that can supply continuous, stable energy for CentreBrain. As a member of the COSMO and a pioneer of the Dyson Sphere Program, you will use a terminal-controlled mech to embark on an unknown journey. Starting from scratch, you will collect resources, design your production lines and finally achieve full automation. You will establish a giant intergalactic industrial empire from scratch, and carve out your own path to a miracle of the universe, the Dyson Sphere.\r\n\r\nBuilder of the Great Civilization, you are certain to encounter unforeseen challenges that may take you by surprise, for the vast expanse of space is rife with the unexpected and anything can come to pass. With your boundless creativity and vivid imagination, the attainment of this magnificent objective is well within your reach, and the vast expanse of the planetary system shall be transformed into a veritable bedrock of human civilization, all by virtue of your strategic plans."

   "And that is why COSMO proposed the Dyson Sphere Program. Countless engineers have headed to different planetary systems as pioneers of human civilization. Their mission is to build the Dyson Sphere to supply unlimited energy to CentreBrain. This all started from a remote cluster, which then proceeded to spring up again one after another. Engineers sent back warnings, but this did not prevent one plant after another from getting destroyed until calls were no longer responded to. Those clusters then fell into utter silence. CentreBrain analyzed the energy fluctuations and images, and concluded that the assaults came from mutated robot units that had engulfed massive clusters like \"dark fog\". This is why surviving engineers named them Dark Fog.\r\n\r\nBrave Engineer, you've selected a cluster that may be infested with Dark Fog, so you may face numerous challenges.

   "A Gas Giant is a large planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a core made of ice and rock. Due to the extremely high pressure and temperature of its interior, deep within the atmosphere of the giant is a vast ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen.\r\nThese giants are characterized by year-round gales, which carry clouds and large amounts of material in a direction parallel to its latitudes, creating ring-like streaks and bright bands. Winds from different directions often collide, creating vortices and thunderbolts.\r\nBecause of its proximity to a star, the atmosphere of this gas giant is constantly stripped away by solar winds until only a rocky nucleus remains. Gas Giants are rich in nuclear fuel and other resources, and placing collectors in their orbits will provide a steady supply of both regular and heavy hydrogen."

Ice-laden comets are the planets’ main source of water, and so the average precipitation levels recorded on Prairiea planets are insufficient to support complex biospheres.\r\nOther hypotheses such as \"solar wind stripping\" and \"soil formation process obstruction\" have also been suggested. However, the end result is the same: these lush planets are suitable for the extensive development of organic industry."

The Ice Giant has no solid surface on which to land, with only a faint boundary between its atmosphere and icy mantle.\r\nThe methane in the giant's atmosphere absorbs red and infrared spectra at wavelengths above 600 nm, giving the planet a bluish color.

A glimpse from space reveals that Mariterra planets have a very similar landscape and climate to that of our home planet, which not only relieves Icarus of its homesickness, but also provides a familiar environment for it to get into the swing of its workflow.\r\nThe planets’ fragmented continental shelves may lead to more diverse civilizations of local intelligent life. Relatively narrower oceans may facilitate their ability to communicate, while denser seismic zones may make them more inclined to cooperate with each other. Upon the arrival of our mecha, we will probably encounter a class I-II civilization that is already reasonably developed. If we can gain their cooperation, it will save Icarus from many of the most tedious processes involved in the early development of an industrial system, and unify the local stellar system’s resources when progressing the Dyson Sphere program.\r\nSparing a thought for the borderline unimaginable situation that \"there is no indigenous civilization on a Mariterra planet\", COSMO is working on it and promises to respond within 15 working days after the plan is finalized."

Researchers believe this was caused during its molten planet phase, when it crashed into an icy planet traveling at about the same speed, causing the planet to cool rapidly. This impact caused material from the core to be thrown onto the surface, which is why it is so iron-rich.\r\nSuch a special environment has created a rarity known as a Grating Crystal. Researchers offered to conduct further experiments to test this theory; however, most of the department had left their jobs by this time to indulge in the virtual world, meaning the application for research funding was ultimately abandoned due to extensive processing delays."

   "In the future, humanity advances into a highly evolved civilization, and the powerful technologies bring about rapid development. Human beings have used virtual reality to iterate through space and time, created a virtual universe much larger than the real world, and uploaded all human consciousness into it.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the virtual universe requires immense computing capabilities. To achieve this, humans have invented a supercomputer that surrounds the sun and name it \"CentreBrain\", hoping to use its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the virtual Homeland. As the number of consciousnesses continues to grow, CentreBrain's computing power will soon reach its limit. After all, more consciousnesses means more energy supply. For this reason, the COSMO launched a project with the code name \"Dyson Sphere Program\", assigning engineers to the real world to build Dyson Spheres that can supply continuous, stable energy for CentreBrain. As a member of the COSMO and a pioneer of the Dyson Sphere Program, you will use a terminal-controlled mech to embark on an unknown journey. Starting from scratch, you will collect resources, design your production lines and finally achieve full automation. You will establish a giant intergalactic industrial empire from scratch, and carve out your own path to a miracle of the universe, the Dyson Sphere.\r\n\r\nBuilder of the Great Civilization, you are certain to encounter unforeseen challenges that may take you by surprise, for the vast expanse of space is rife with the unexpected and anything can come to pass. With your boundless creativity and vivid imagination, the attainment of this magnificent objective is well within your reach, and the vast expanse of the planetary system shall be transformed into a veritable bedrock of human civilization, all by virtue of your strategic plans."

For example, the ratio can be set to 1:5 when you are away to ensure the game's simulation speed.\r\n\r\nElaboration:\r\n\r\nThe frame rate displayed in <color=#7EFC5DB4>green digits</color> is the render frame rate, which indicates the refresh rate of the graphics and usually depends on GPU performance.\r\nThe frame rate displayed in <color=#61D8FFB6>blue digits</color> is the logic frame rate, which indicates the computing rate of the game simulation and usually depends on CPU performance.\r\nThe target logic frame rate of the game is always <color=#61D8FFB6>60ups</color> to ensure that one second in the game world is equivalent to one second in the real world.\r\nWhen the ratio is set to 1:3 and the render frame rate falls below <color=#7EFC5DB4>20fps</color>, the game's simulation speed will decrease.\r\nSimilarly, when the ratio is set to 1:2 and the render frame rate falls below <color=#7EFC5DB4>30fps</color>, the game's simulation speed will also decrease.\r\nIf the game's simulation speed falls below <color=#61D8FFB6>60ups</color>, the render frame rate will be reduced to <color=#7EFC5DB4>30fps</color> to maintain a logic frame rate that is as close as possible to the <color=#61D8FFB6>60ups</color> target.\r\nWhen the ratio is set to 1:1, the logic frame rate can be slightly reduced to ensure video smoothness. \r\nWhen the ratio is set to 1:3, the render frame rate can be decreased further to <color=#7EFC5DB4>20fps</color> in order to maintain a logic frame rate that is as close as possible to the <color=#61D8FFB6>60ups</color> target.",

Some scholars believe that due to a scarcity of magnesium and iron in the primordial nebula of the stellar system where these planets were formed, the crust of Prairiea planets once had a high quartz content,therefore creating a slow soil formation process due to its tough exterior. The end result was a thin soil layer, and so herbaceous plants with shallow root systems have become the dominant species on these planets.\r\nOther hypotheses such as \"solar wind stripping\" and \"soil formation process obstruction\" have also been suggested.

   "In the future, humanity advances into a highly evolved civilization, and the powerful technologies bring about rapid development. Human beings have used virtual reality to iterate through space and time, created a virtual universe much larger than the real world, and uploaded all human consciousness into it.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the virtual universe requires immense computing capabilities. To achieve this, humans have invented a supercomputer that surrounds the sun and name it \"CentreBrain\", hoping to use its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the virtual Homeland. As the number of consciousnesses continues to grow, CentreBrain's computing power will soon reach its limit. After all, more consciousnesses means more energy supply. For this reason, the COSMO launched a project with the code name \"Dyson Sphere Program\", assigning engineers to the real world to build Dyson Spheres that can supply continuous, stable energy for CentreBrain. As a member of the COSMO and a pioneer of the Dyson Sphere Program, you will use a terminal-controlled mech to embark on an unknown journey. Starting from scratch, you will collect resources, design your production lines and finally achieve full automation. You will establish a giant intergalactic industrial empire from scratch, and carve out your own path to a miracle of the universe, the Dyson Sphere.\r\n\r\nBuilder of the Great Civilization, you are certain to encounter unforeseen challenges that may take you by surprise, for the vast expanse of space is rife with the unexpected and anything can come to pass. With your boundless creativity and vivid imagination, the attainment of this magnificent objective is well within your reach, and the vast expanse of the planetary system shall be transformed into a veritable bedrock of human civilization, all by virtue of your strategic plans."

   "And that is why COSMO proposed the Dyson Sphere Program. Countless engineers have headed to different planetary systems as pioneers of human civilization. Their mission is to build the Dyson Sphere to supply unlimited energy to CentreBrain. This all started from a remote cluster, which then proceeded to spring up again one after another. Engineers sent back warnings, but this did not prevent one plant after another from getting destroyed until calls were no longer responded to. Those clusters then fell into utter silence. CentreBrain analyzed the energy fluctuations and images, and concluded that the assaults came from mutated robot units that had engulfed massive clusters like \"dark fog\". This is why surviving engineers named them Dark Fog.\r\n\r\nBrave Engineer, you've selected a cluster that may be infested with Dark Fog, so you may face numerous challenges. But we still believe that with your courage and wisdom, you will kick off a new chapter of brilliant human civilization."

   "A Gas Giant is a large planet composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a core made of ice and rock. Due to the extremely high pressure and temperature of its interior, deep within the atmosphere of the giant is a vast ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen.\r\nThese giants are characterized by year-round gales, which carry clouds and large amounts of material in a direction parallel to its latitudes, creating ring-like streaks and bright bands. Winds from different directions often collide, creating vortices and thunderbolts.\r\nBecause of its proximity to a star, the atmosphere of this gas giant is constantly stripped away by solar winds until only a rocky nucleus remains. Gas Giants are rich in nuclear fuel and other resources, and placing collectors in their orbits will provide a steady supply of both regular and heavy hydrogen."

   "A cold, rocky planet with an atmosphere consisting mainly of nitrogen, its surface is covered with deserts and snow mounds made of dry ice.\r\nThe reason for the dryness of these planets is that they were first formed within the freeze line, and therefore could not be attracted by gravity alone. The water, ammonia and methane that was precipitated from the magma or taken from smaller bodies after the planet took shape escaped from the surface, later reaching higher orbits and becoming disturbed by other celestial bodies where the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere froze into snowflakes at ultra-low temperatures.

The giant's sufficiently large self-gravity allows it to possess an extremely dense atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, but fails to evolve further into a Gas Giant because any nebulosity is blown away by solar winds or used by other planets during formation.\r\nThe ice content of an Ice Giant's atmosphere increases with decreasing altitude, while its icy mantle is in a state of supercritical fluid at very high atmospheric pressure. The Ice Giant has no solid surface on which to land, with only a faint boundary between its atmosphere and icy mantle.\r\nThe methane in the giant's atmosphere absorbs red and infrared spectra at wavelengths above 600 nm, giving the planet a bluish color. The haze in the atmosphere appears to be more snow condensed from methane due to its lower temperature, with the presence of methane snow making it reflect a clearer pale blue color."

It will dispatch vessels to transfer the Base's matter production to the Hive and ship back energy to the Base. Relays are the last ensurance of the Hive. If a Planetary Base is destroyed, its Relay will try to rebuild it if thers is remaining matter and energy. If the Central Core of a Hive is destroyed, Relays will send Heavy Barge to reconstruct the Core. Given the importance of Relay Stations, attacking them amounts to declaring full-scale war on the Dark Fog. Some hapless engineers have ended up as its casualties, even though they just wanted to test the Missile Turrets."

A glimpse from space reveals that Mariterra planets have a very similar landscape and climate to that of our home planet, which not only relieves Icarus of its homesickness, but also provides a familiar environment for it to get into the swing of its workflow.\r\nThe planets’ fragmented continental shelves may lead to more diverse civilizations of local intelligent life. Relatively narrower oceans may facilitate their ability to communicate, while denser seismic zones may make them more inclined to cooperate with each other. Upon the arrival of our mecha, we will probably encounter a class I-II civilization that is already reasonably developed. If we can gain their cooperation, it will save Icarus from many of the most tedious processes involved in the early development of an industrial system, and unify the local stellar system’s resources when progressing the Dyson Sphere program.\r\nSparing a thought for the borderline unimaginable situation that \"there is no indigenous civilization on a Mariterra planet\", COSMO is working on it and promises to respond within 15 working days after the plan is finalized."

Researchers believe this was caused during its molten planet phase, when it crashed into an icy planet traveling at about the same speed, causing the planet to cool rapidly. This impact caused material from the core to be thrown onto the surface, which is why it is so iron-rich.\r\nSuch a special environment has created a rarity known as a Grating Crystal.
